      "description":"SPHAR is a video dataset for human action recognition. Its main purpose is to support research in the application area of analyzing activities on public places. In this domain, most cameras will share a similar mounting angle and perspective, which we will call the surveillance perspective from now on. In SPHAR, all videos are shot from this or a similar perspective. The videos have been aggregated from multiple sources, converted to a consistent file type (H265 HEVC .mp4), cutted and cropped (spatio-temporally) to contain only one action at a time and last but not least sorted into 14 action classes. This Repository contains all videos of the SPHAR dataset as well as the scripts needed to create the dataset.",
